Many thanks are due:

* to "Raina/Titan", for the lovely sound track (sfx/start.xm) first
  created for the Amiga OS4 port;

* to Toru Iwatani, for the simple but brilliant concept that became
  Namco's Pac-Man/Puckman;

* to the programmers at GCC and Midway who created "Crazy Otto" and
  its commercial version, Ms. Pac-Man, by disassembling and improving
  the original Pac-Man ROMs; this sequel is without a doubt one of
  the best arcade games ever created;

* to "Spot", for the Amiga OS4 port and music support;

* to the many programmers who have written their own Pac-Man ports,
  clones, sequels, and other derivatives -- especially those whose
  designs have inspired MyMan's maze layouts;

* to Eugene Aalto (may he rest in peace), for many early suggestions
  on improved ghost movements, color, and other details that make
  MyMan feel more like the addictive arcade games it strives to
  imitate;

* to Willard Goosey, for the patient but persistent suggestions that
  MyMan not use resources in such a profligate manner;

* to Stefan Sittler, both for the dare that led to the first version
  of MyMan and for the later graphics in the style of "Crazy Otto";

* to many others I am surely forgetting;

* and to my family, for their patience, sacrifice and understanding
  while I spend time on this project without hope of reward.
